IBM HR Employee Analytics Dashboard
This repository contains the Tableau project file for an interactive HR dashboard focused on analyzing employee data. The dashboard visualizes key metrics related to demographics, compensation, job roles, and employee attrition.

üí° About The Project
This Tableau project was developed to provide a comprehensive, at-a-glance view of a company's human resources data. By consolidating various employee metrics into a single interactive dashboard, it allows HR managers, analysts, and decision-makers to identify trends, pinpoint areas for improvement, and understand the factors that may influence employee attrition and satisfaction. The dashboard is designed to be intuitive, enabling users to filter and drill down into the data to uncover deeper insights. An IBM logo is included in the dashboard design.

‚ú® Key Features

Demographic Analysis: Interactive charts for visualizing the workforce distribution by gender, age, and marital status.

Departmental & Role Insights: Detailed breakdown of employee counts and average salaries by department and specific job roles.

Education & Experience Profile: Analysis of employees' educational backgrounds and the number of companies they worked for previously.
